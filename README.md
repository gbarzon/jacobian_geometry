# Unraveling the latent geometry of network-driven processes

Complex systems are characterized by emergent patterns created by the non-trivial interplay between dynamical processes and the networks of interactions on which these processes unfold. Topological or dynamical descriptors alone are not enough to fully embrace this interplay in all its complexity, and many times one has to resort to dynamics-specific approaches that limit a comprehension of general principles.<br>
To address this challenge, we employ a metric - that we name **Jacobian distance** - which captures the spatiotemporal spreading of perturbations, enabling us to uncover the latent geometry inherent in network-driven processes.
